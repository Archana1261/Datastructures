AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT: To perform linear search on a given array

DESCRIPTION:
1. We use linear search to find whether a number is present in an array or not.
2. If it is present,then at ehat location it occurs.
3. It is also known as sequential search.
4. We compare each element with the element to be searched until we find it or the list ends

STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
1. Declare an array 'a' of size 10 and enter the elements of the array.
2. Scan for the value of key element to be found.
3. initialise i = 0.
4. Using for loop check the key element with the each element present in the array.
5. If the key element does not found with the elements in the array,search is unsuccessful.

output 1(if the input is 66): If the key value to be found is given as 66,then it prints the search is successful at position 8.

output 2(if the input is 0) : If the key value to be found is 0,then it prints the search is unsuccessful.
